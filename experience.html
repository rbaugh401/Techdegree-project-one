            <h2>Graphic Designer</h2>
            <p>After my first love of finger painting, I have always enjoyed other forms of painting and creativity. Most recently I have begun to master design tools to compile catchy flyers and ads using graphics from free or low-cost subscription sites. Rather than creating all my visuals from scratch, I have learned how to adapt existing pieces to share my message, all while cutting time and effort.</p>

            <h2>English Major</h2>
            <p>I love to read which prompted a love of good writing. Over the years I've honed my editing skills as well, and memorized all the quirky grammar rules of the English language...or at least, where to look them up!</p>

            <h2>Problem Solver</h2>
            <p>There is probably a more efficient way to do most tasks, and I enjoy experimenting to find those shortcuts. And catering to the tastes of others, I've learned to come at projects from three or four angles to find the best fit for the content and client.</p>
